* Add a file so we can know whether the tests passed.

i.e. if we run `./mk -t` then we can know whether the tests pass or not.
If not, delete the file, if it passes create the file. If the binary file
to run the test has a timestamp more recent than the test file the
snapbuilder creates, then the tests were not yet run against the latest
version and we should do so before we run a Launchpad build.
