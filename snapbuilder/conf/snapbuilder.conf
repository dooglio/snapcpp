# release_names=<name1>,<name2>,...
#
# A list of release names separated by commas.
#
# This is the list of releases currently supported on Launchpad. In most cases,
# this list doesn't change much at all.
#
# The list of architectures (see below) is actually controlled on Launchpad
# directly, but we also need that other list to know which file(s) to check
# for the latest compiled version of a package.
#
# Default: <none>
release_names=xenial,bionic,focal,hirsute


# architecture_names=<name1>,<name2>,...
#
# A list of architectures to check and see whether the compile process
# worked on or not.
#
# Which architectures are supported for (unfortunately, all) the packages
# is defined by check boxes on Launchpad. We still need to have a list
# here because the Packages.gz files we download are specific to an
# architecture. So to be able to test all the versions and know where
# we're at, we have to have these names.
#
# Default: <empty>
#server_tcp=


# server_udp=<ip-address>:<port>
#
# The IP address and port to listen on with a UDP connection. The parameter
# is used to listen to LOG messages which clients send to the server.
#
# By default this parameter is not set meaning that you do not want to receive
# LOG messages over UDP. Note that there is another UDP connection (the
# `udp_listen` parameter). That other connection is used to send control
# messages, including support for a `LOG` message used to reset the output
# files after rotation by a tool such as logrotate.
#
# Default: <empty>
#server_udp=


# udp_listen=<ip-address>:<port>
#
# A UDP-based control port of the snaplogger daemon.
#
# This port is used for similar reason as the `listen=...` port. It is
# particularly useful to send a UDP message to reset the logger files
# after rotation. Although it can be done with the TCP connection
# (defined by `listen=...`) it's not practical to just send a message
# and forget about it. Over the TCP connection, the daemon sends a reply
# which we have to listen for.
#
# Default: 127.0.0.1:4051
udp_listen=127.0.0.1:4051
